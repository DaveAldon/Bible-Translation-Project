          The Bible Translation Project is an effort to show where your favorite
          translation comes from, what manuscripts were used to create it, and
          why it was made in the first place. Bible translations are often based
          on other translations, various manuscripts, and commentaries. But
          which ones? How far removed are they from the original text? What
          books do they include, or omit? How do they relate to each other? Why
          do they exist? Who wrote them?
